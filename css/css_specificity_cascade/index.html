        <!-- to resolve these types of conflicts css have The Cascade Algorithm -->
        <!-- Has 4 distinct stages.

        Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear [if selector are of same type]
        Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match [inline css>id>classes or attribute selector>elment>universal(*)]
        
        specificity calculation:
            universal: 0;
            element: 1;
            class and attribute or pseudo class : 10;
            id: 100;
            inline: 1000;
            !important: 10000;

        in case of complex selector add specificty of all the individual slelector eg in h1.cred -- >11 .cred#a -- > 110  a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover  -- > 1+10+10+10+10=41

            
        Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS [by the browser]
        Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type [most priority]
